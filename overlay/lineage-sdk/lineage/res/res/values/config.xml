    <!-- All the capabilities of the LEDs on this device, stored as a bit field.
         This integer should equal the sum of the corresponding value for each
         of the following capabilities present:
         LIGHTS_RGB_NOTIFICATION_LED = 1
         LIGHTS_RGB_BATTERY_LED = 2
         LIGHTS_MULTIPLE_NOTIFICATION_LED = 4 (deprecated)
         LIGHTS_PULSATING_LED = 8
         LIGHTS_SEGMENTED_BATTERY_LED = 16
         LIGHTS_ADJUSTABLE_NOTIFICATION_LED_BRIGHTNESS = 32
         LIGHTS_BATTERY_LED = 64
         For example, a device with notification and battery lights
         that support pulsating and RGB control would set this config
         to 75. -->
